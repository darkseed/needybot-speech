      Needybot Unit Test Run File
      ===========================
      This is essentially a launch file that is made to run with rostest.
      Add in your node- and code-level unit test calls in here, following
      the patterns below.

      More information can be found at http://wiki.ros.org/rostest.

      Node-Level Tests
      =====================================================================
      If you are running a node-level unit test, you would include the node
      in this launch file, above the call for the unit tests.

      This then fires up the node, and runs the tests.

      **Example:**
      <node pkg="needybot" type="some_node_we_have.py" name="some_node_we_have" />
      <test test-name="test_some_node" pkg="needybot_test" type="test_some_node.py" />

      Code-Level Tests
      =====================================================================
      If you are running a code-level unit test, you can just add the file
      in as a test declaration, which will simply run the test file.

      **Example:**
      <test test-name="test_some_node" pkg="needybot_test" type="test_some_node.py" />

  <rosparam file="$(find needybot_speech)/param/needybot_voice.yml" command="load" />
  <rosparam file="$(find needybot_speech)/param/speech_manifest.yml" command="load" ns="needybot/speech/dialog" />

  <test test-name="test_needybot_speech" pkg="needybot_speech" type="test_needybot_speech.py"/>
</launch>
